<p>After a careful timing analysis of the steps defined in RFC5011 and
  the timing described in RFC7583, issues were 
found that could lead to denial of service attacks.
<a href="https://github.com/hardaker/draft-rfc5011-security-considerations">draft-rfc5011-security-considerations</a>
discusses the issues found and the suggested fixes to the timing
considerations and adding additional terms to the RFC7583 Itrp equation.
Specifically, this never-published draft states:

  Note: The equation for Itrp in RFC7583 is insecure as it does not
          include the sigExpirationTime listed above [which is defined
          as "The amount of time between the DNSKEY RRSIG's Signature
          Inception field and the Signature Expiration field."]. The
          Itrp equation in RFC7583 also does not include the 2*TTL
          safety margin, though that is an operational consideration.
