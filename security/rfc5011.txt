<p>After a careful timing analysis of the steps defined in RFC5011, issues were 
found that could lead to denial of service attacks.
<a href="https://github.com/hardaker/draft-rfc5011-security-considerations">draft-rfc5011-security-considerations</a>
discusses the issues found and the suggested fixes to the timing
considerations.  Though acknowledged as true by the RFC5011 author,
the security considerations draft was never published as an RFC (read
the DNSOP email archives for further information).</p>
