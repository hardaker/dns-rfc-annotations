<p>After a careful timing analysis of the steps defined in RFC5011, issues were 
found that could lead to denial of service attacks.
<a href="https://github.com/hardaker/draft-rfc5011-security-considerations">draft-rfc5011-security-considerations</a>
discusses the issues found and the suggested fixes to the timing
considerations.  Though acknowledged as true by the RFC5011 author,
the security considerations draft was never published as an RFC (read
the DNSOP email archives for further information).
</p>
<p>
  Specifically, the new attack vector is described fully in the
  above document but is summarized in the following paragraph:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2em;">
      RFC5011 defines a mechanism by which DNSSEC
      validators can update their list of trust anchors when they've seen a
      new key published in a zone or revoke a properly marked key from a trust
      anchor list. However, RFC5011 [intentionally] provides no guidance to
      the publishers of DNSKEYs about how long they must wait before switching
      to exclusively using recently published keys for signing records, or how
      long they must wait before ceasing publication of a revoked key. Because
      of this lack of guidance, zone publishers may arrive at incorrect
      assumptions about safe usage of the RFC5011 DNSKEY advertising, rolling
      and revocation process. This document describes the minimum security
      requirements from a publisher's point of view and is intended to
      complement the guidance offered in RFC5011 (which is written to provide
      timing guidance solely to a Validating Resolver's point of view).

<p>There is an annotation for Section 8 that someone suggested I
  mention at the top of this document to ensure people see the
  important changes in the timing and security ramifications.</p>
